I'm Katarina. I play flute, compose music, and use computers to create music, often shaped by mathematics. I sometimes make algorithms. I like to read, dance, and explore.

I am currently a coding instructor at [The Digital Arts Experience](https://www.thedae.com), a STEAM learning center in Westchester. I am the *public relations coordinator* of [Music Community Lab](http://musiccommunitylab.org) and regularly help produce the [Monthly Music Hackathon NYC](http://monthlymusichackathon.org) series. I am a member of the [Lehman College and Community Band](http://www.lehman.edu/academics/arts-humanities/music/community-band.php), a latin jazz ensemble, and a community marching band for young women.

I am formerly of [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu), where I studied mathematics and was introduced to music technology (B.S. Math '13), and the [College of William & Mary](http://www.wm.edu), where I studied Computational Operations Research (M.S. Computer Science '15). From September 2016 until December 2017 I was [UNA-USA Westchester Chapter](http://www.unawestchester.org)'s *communications intern*.
