## Artist Statement
<span>"</span>My artistic works examine relations that are inherently part of being oneself
and embodying space. The relations themselves are common ones
such as the relation between oneself and one’s thoughts juxtaposed with
those of another or others or the trace of one’s actions to the space one
exists in. Given my current training as an Intermedial artist, my works
exists in multiple media, with a larger emphasis on works predicated on
directions and code and than those that are not. My works often focuses
on auditory and visual senses and asks the viewer-listener-user-participant
to either stand witness to the piece or to actually manipulate
it. Most of my works exist in transitory forms, mimicking the temporality
of experiences and relations as well as the temporary nature of a body
of work that is often some form of new media art.
