## Artist Statement
My artistic works examine relations that are inherently part of being oneself
and embodying space. The relations themselves are common ones
such as the relation between oneself and one’s thoughts juxtaposed with
those of another or others or the trace of one’s actions to the space one
exists in. Given my current training as an Intermedial artist, my works
exists in multiple media, with a larger emphasis on works predicated on
directions and code and than those that are not. My works often focuses
on auditory and visual senses and asks the viewer-listener-userparticipant
to either stand witness to the piece or to actually manipulate
it. Most of my works exist in transitory forms, mimicking the temporality
of experiences and relations as well as the temporary nature of a body
of work that is often some form of new media art.

combination of computer generated visuals and sound to walk an audience
member or participant through a take Recently explored relations
include the recognition of media reconstituted from elementary parts,
confronting mental health concepts in virtual or physical space, or using
the relations of time, place and memory to interpret scientific happenings
inside the brain.
