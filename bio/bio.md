Katarina Hoeger is fascinated by relations that are inherently part of being
oneself and embodying space. She picks specific relations to examine
in each work and then creates an experience using media, often a combination
of computer generated visuals and sound to provide an audience
member or participant a setup to peruse. Recently explored relations
include the recognition of media reconstituted from elementary parts,
confronting mental health concepts in virtual or physical space, or using
the relations of time, place and memory to interpret scientific happenings
inside the brain.

Katarina Hoeger is currently a Master of Fine Arts Candidate in Intermedia
