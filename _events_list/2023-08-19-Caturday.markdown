#### Statement from artist
- I performed under the name *Cougars Are Cats Too*.
My set introduced the audience to various severely threatened cat species and rhythms from their countries of origin. The sounds were derived from flute samples.  I used a mixture of MaxMSP and Processing, communicating over OSC, to coordinate my audio and visuals.
