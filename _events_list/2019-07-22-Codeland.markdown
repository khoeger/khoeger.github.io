## Workshop
### Making Musical Code
Have you ever used code to generate a melody? By the end of this workshop, each participant will map input text to musical notes and then generate a melody using Python. Good-to-haves include headphones, a will to use Python libraries, lists, and more, and a will to explore basic musical concepts.
