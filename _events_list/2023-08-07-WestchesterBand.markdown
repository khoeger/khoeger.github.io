The Westchester Band plays a series of concerts.
Music varies in style - there are classical pieces, popular, movie themes, musical themes, ethnic tunes, and dance tunes such as tango and swing.
Learn more about Westchester Band at it's website,  [https://westchesterband.org/](https://westchesterband.org/).
This is a community band - professionals play alongside high school students.
There are members who have played in concert halls across the globe, leading to very masterfully played music.
The band plays new music each week.  
The first concert of the summer is at Scarsdale Town Pool, alongside fireworks.
In case of rain, the concert is moved indoors to Scarsdale High School. Notice will be posted on the website.

Katarina Hoeger plays flute from within the second flute section and works in the crew.
