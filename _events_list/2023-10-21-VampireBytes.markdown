### LiveCodeNYC Presents…
#### Night of the Living Code II: Vampire Bytes! 🧛‍♀️

Saturday, October 21st, Wonderville and LiveCodeNYC come together again for a night of chills and thrills as performers spellbind you with their live coded audio and visual creations. You’ll see apparitions in the pixels 👻, hear the moans of zombies crackle in the audio 🧟, and, since it’s live, most likely a few “bugs” that will make your skin crawl 🐛

#### Statement from artist
- I performed under the name *Cougars Are Cats Too*.
I created a soundscape composed of creepy sounds: footsteps, water dropping, boards creaking, wind, silence, and a haunting fall melody I learned in kindergarten and recorded on flute. These sounds are played at different speeds and times. They are also accompanied on occasion by stanzas from a poem describing the most supernatural seeming encounter I have had up until now. I used SuperCollider to manage the sound samples and TidalCycles to mix and sequence my set. genesis rogue provided visuals to complement my audio using hydra and personal artwork.
