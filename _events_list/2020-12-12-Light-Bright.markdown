{{page.title}} is a holiday celebration of lights.
The show features University of Maine Intermedia students' projections on the buildings of downtown Bangor.
It is a show meant to provide some of the holiday cheer that would otherwise be found in holiday markets, parades, and the multitudes of gatherings that are on hold due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The projections loop between 5 and 7PM.
Come gather outside or drive by and enjoy the lights!

Arturo Camacho is {{page.title}}'s curator and director.
The participating artists are Ian Beckett, Arturo Camacho, Adriana Cavalcanti, Lia Davido, Armando Garma, Thomas Griffith, Reed Hayden, Katarina Hoeger, Heidi Kraepel, Rochelle Lawrence and Anna Martin.

Katarina Hoeger presents *Dance: on Buildings*, 2020.
It features an animation of the outlines of local dancers extracted from video shot by Amber Saucier and Terence Lee as well as Katarina's photographs featuring the local beauty of Bangor City Forest.
