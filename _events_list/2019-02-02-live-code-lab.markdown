Come discuss music, math, and code with me at the event, and let's learn about Live Coding together!

If you'd like to learn more about Music Community Lab, or how you can help out, I am happy to talk about this. Special shoutout to Jason Sigal and the lovely Live Code NYC crew for their hard work putting together this event.
