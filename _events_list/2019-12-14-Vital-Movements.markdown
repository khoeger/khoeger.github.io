We are constantly in motion. We take action to advance causes we believe in and to
explore, nurture, and protect our internal selves. Through these vital movements, we
protect our safe havens, be they the environment, our family traditions, our internal
selves, or our communities.

Come grab a beer and peruse the videos. 

Katarina Hoeger presents *Blues Consent*, 2019.
