I performed "Ain't No Sunshine" and "Death Came a Knockin'" on a stage as dancers danced below. I extend a special thanks to [Big Frank and the Healers](https://www.facebook.com/BigFrankAndTheHealers/) for their accompaniment.

## Reflections
I was performing for friends. 
Instead performing with the mindset of uplifting their lives, I performed with the goal of encouraging dance to uplift lives. I need to determine a method of evaluating success.
