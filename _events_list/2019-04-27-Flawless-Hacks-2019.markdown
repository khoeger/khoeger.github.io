[Flawless Hacks](http://flawlesshacks.com) is a yearly hackathon in NYC that serves as a meetup for non-male identifying people interested in code to learn and make projects together.

## Project
I began work on a `Blues Dance Music Playlist Generator`. This year, I did not have partners.

### Concept
The idea:
- make a list of blues artists
- search Spotify using its API for the artist's music
- make a playlist from the result, limiting the list to a certain BPM

### Code
Coming soon to Github.

### Media
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you, <a href="https://twitter.com/FlawlessHack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FlawlessHack</a> for the experience :) I always enjoy your hackathons! It was great mingling with other women who code, known and new.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll finish this sometime - now that I&#39;ve got the hang of using the API, I want to be able to use the hack for my own purposes. <a href="https://t.co/UxhDsS4djB">https://t.co/UxhDsS4djB</a></p>&mdash; KHoeger (@kfhoeger) <a href="https://twitter.com/kfhoeger/status/1122559942307848192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2019</a></blockquote>
