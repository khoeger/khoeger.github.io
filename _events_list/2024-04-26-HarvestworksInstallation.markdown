### Artist Statement - About "Motion: Constrained @ My _____ is an Ecosystem"
This installation is the third installment of the "Motion" series. It focuses on sonifying motions made within the constrained environment of a hallway.

The “Motion” series encourages using sound and motion to explore being embodied. It provides the opportunity for instinctive and joyful bodily exploration. Participants explore their bodies’ placements and impacts on the environment and its constituents. “Motion” is also a social experiment, studying how visitors choose to engage with the work, what patterns of interaction occur, how visitors influence each other, and how the system's responses influence visitors to act.

### Group Exhibition
Processes. Loops. Glitch. Noise. Feedback. Nostalgia. Sustainability. World building. An ecosystem of ecosystems. This year’s show, [My ______ is an Ecosystem](https://www.harvestworks.org/livecodenyc2024-apr-26-may-5/) (said “my blank is an ecosystem”) features a selection of art, workshops, discussions, and performances that explore the former ideas in many ways.

From interactive installations to video art, and audiovisual performances to sculpture, this exhibition features artists using live coding, artificial intelligence, custom electronics and software, repurposed electronics and e-waste, permacomputing, and more.

The title of the show refers to the relationships these featured artists build with their imaginations and tools. An alternative name for this show could be “This is an ecosystem,” referring to this collection of work, the event, and the community of artists involved.

This year's exhibition is part of a [Livecode.NYC](https://livecode.nyc/) group residency at [Harvestworks](https://www.harvestworks.org/). This year, it is organized by [Cameron Alexander](https://emptyfla.sh/), [Eric Lee](https://www.instagram.com/eggsovereager/), and [Melody Loveless](https://www.melodyloveless.com/) with assistance from stage manager [Fuguo Xue](https://fuguoxue.github.io/).
