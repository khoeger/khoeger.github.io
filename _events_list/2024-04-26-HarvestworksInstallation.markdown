### About the presenters
**Katarina Hoeger ’13** (she/her, mathematics) creates artistic experiences that invite participants to explore their embodiment and the impacts of their presences on their immediate environments. Her artist rigs are mediated by code. Some works include real-time data processing and immediate sonic feedback while others rely on generated visuals or sounds. Hoeger has been an artist-in-residence at Bethany Arts Community. She participates in Music Community Lab and LiveCode.NYC events. She holds the degrees of MFA in intermedia from the University of Maine, M.S. in computer science with a specialization in computational operations research from the College of William & Mary, and B.S. in mathematics from Harvey Mudd College.

**Jessica Stringham ’13** (they/them, computer science) is a creative coder and machine learning engineer based in Brooklyn, New York. They enjoy trying to put distant memories of Harvey Mudd Core classes to use by finding creative ways to use concepts and then turn around and create weird glitchy art by cranking parameters past what the code was intended to handle. They have performed live visuals at shows associated with LiveCode.NYC and ITP-NYU. They have a B.S. in computer science from Harvey Mudd College, an MSc in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, and work as a staff machine learning engineer at Spotify.

### Organizers
Organized by Vanessa Chiu of the Office of Alumni and Parent Relations at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA.
