### About Flute And Viola Duo

Katarina Hoeger, artist, musician, mathematician, coder, and dancer, has played flute for 22 years. She is classically trained, with experience playing in ensembles ranging from latin and middle eastern to orchestras. Through dance she learned to love the blues, and she signed up for this community jam to share her love of music with her blues friends. Katarina invited her longtime friend and music making companion, Evan Pittson, to play with her to enhance her experience of playing music in a partnership similar to the one between social dancers on the floor.

Evan Pittson is a violist, arranger, and composer. He has performed in orchestral and chamber ensembles from an early age, and has since dedicated his artistic craft to improvisation, as a soloist in jazz, R&B, funk, fusion, and world music. He also composes for and leads the Pittson Family Band, alongside vocalist Suzanne Pittson, and keyboardist Jeff Pittson, which has performed around the world.

Katarina is a blues dancer who frequents the Blues Dance New York community. She invited Evan to perform with her. They met while playing in their Buddhist group's youth orchestra in 2007, and have remained friends since. Evan's presence allows for the two to  engage in a musical dialogue while performing similar to the one dance partners share on the floor.
