Explore the our human actions through the machine interface provided by "Motion: Connecting Body with Sound and Position, II" at LiveCode.NYC's May 2023 algorave, themed human.machine.interface. 
The May 2023 iterations of "Motion" will differ from the May 2022 version, leaving visitors familiar with both the opportunity to experience a progression on the theme. 

This is the first installation of "Motion" that is accessible to the greater NYC public.
