The project I have been working on over the last year is **Vortex of Sound**.
The goal is to use mathematics and traditional composition techniques to create an interesting audio experience,
targeted for headphones. The experience itself? It's what it sounds like -- sound
spiraling around you in various ways.

# Basic Concept & Inspiration

## Concept
Imagine a collection of hundreds or thousands of people playing instruments.
They are standing in a ring around you. What might that musical experience sound like?

Now, imagine that they aren't just stationary, but are circling you while playing.
How has your listening experience changed?

Now, what if the players could walk through you? And could float?
In this case, the ring becomes a vortex, and it will move from far away,
pass through you, and end far away. All the while, it will rotate.
How will this change your listening experience?

I am not sure what the end result will sound like.
I hope that the end result is interesting and will take a pleasant musical experience and elevate it.

## Inspiration
At the Immersive Music Hackathon in December 2018, I was introduced to the concept of an immersive audio experience.
This is part of my exploration of the concept!
I came up with the idea at the hackathon, and have been slowly figuring out how to implement it since.  

The idea very vaguely is inspired by the motion of a storm.
I respect their sheer power, how they, as a force of nature, can drastically change the environment.
While the shape and motion are modeled somewhat after hurricanes, this project is a homage to all storms, those of nature, ones caused by social or political actions, or ones brewing solely within the listener.
May the experience of a storm force us to examine our environment and our ways, making us wiser, even if we weathered the storm by retreating.

# Process

To understand my process, you need to understand the project's individual parts.
These include
- A musical composition, Celebrating A Benevolent Storm
- A mathematical model of the initial starting point of each "speaker"
- A mathematical model of the motion of each "speaker", detailing its motion through space during the duration of the composition
- Translating the composition from a Finale score into some format that allows for the different parts to be performed from multiple theoretical "speaker" incidences
- Matching up the individual "speaker" incidences with the correct music and location at a specific time
- Scaling the sound output so that dynamics occur and distance is simulated, but the listener is not overwhelmed
- Testing the results

One day, the code involved may be generalizable, and any piece could be played with it.
Right now, I am mostly making a prototype.

# About Updates
Initially, I was just making notes in my note book, and neglecting to update.
I was only planning on updating once a section was complete, and got intimidated.
Therefore, here's a change of plans!

The current plan is to be more transparent in my process.
I will flesh out each of these bullets in future posts,
keeping up a relatively steady moment describing what I have done and am doing.
Some of these posts may be lengthy, but many may be notes describing what I have done and
what isn't quite yet finished.  

Please note, not all posts in the blog will relate to the project introduced in this post.
I will try to indicate which ones are relevant to the project by including the project name,
Vortex of Sound, in the post title.
I am also toying with the idea of updating this blog so that you can search by topic, and also making a projects section, but until these changes happen, please manually search for Vortex of Sound.
