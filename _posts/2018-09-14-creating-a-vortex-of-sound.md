The project I have been working on over the last year is **Vortex of Sound**.
The goal is to take mathematics and create an interesting audio experience to
be heard over headphones. The audio experience? It's what it sounds like -- sound
spiraling around you in various ways.

# Basic Concept & Inspiration


# Process

To understand my process, you need to understand the project's individual parts.
These include
- A musical composition, Celebrating A Benevolent Storm
- A mathematical model of the initial starting point of each "speaker"
- A mathematical model of the motion of each "speaker", detailing its motion through space during the duration of the composition
- Translating the composition from a Finale score into some format that allows for the different parts to be performed from multiple theoretical "speaker" incidences
- Matching up the individual "speaker" incidences with the correct music and location at a specific time
- Scaling the sound output so that dynamics occur and distance is simulated, but the listener is not overwhelmed
- Testing the results

One day, the code involved may be generalizable, and any piece could be played with it.
Right now, I am mostly making a prototype.

# About Updates
Initially, I was just making notes in my note book, and neglecting to update.
I was only planning on updating once a section was complete, and got intimidated.
Therefore, here's a change of plans!

The current plan is to be more transparent in my process.
I will flesh out each of these bullets in future posts,
keeping up a relatively steady moment describing what I have done and am doing.
Some of these posts may be lengthy, but many may be notes describing what I have done and
what isn't quite yet finished.  

Please note, not all posts in the blog will relate to the project introduced in this post.
I will try to indicate which ones are relevant to the project by including the project name,
Vortex of Sound, in the post title.
I am also toying with the idea of updating this blog so that you can search by topic, and also making a projects section, but until these changes happen, please manually search for Vortex of Sound.
