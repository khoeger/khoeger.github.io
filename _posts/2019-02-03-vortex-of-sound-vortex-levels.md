Once the Vortex of Sound is working properly, there will potentially be thousands of instruments swirling around a listener's head. In an attempt to make some of the melody distinguishable, I have decided to create layers in the vortex.

What does this mean? Instrumental lines will be grouped by type, and will be generated at different regions of the vortex based on their type. The groupings I am planning for are counterpoint, harmony, melody, chords, walking bass, and percussion.

## The How

### Loudness
I have made the assumption that the loudness of a musical line is affected by the number of instances of that line, how close it is to your ear, and how much interference it gets from other musical lines. Therefore, I am setting up the sound as if the listener's head is at roughly 5'4", in the middle of the vortex.

How did this play out? I want the melody to be closest to the ears, but the harmony and counterpoint to also come through well. Because the counterpoint is generally very high, and the harmony does not have much time in this particular piece, I placed the harmony closer to the ears than the counterpoint. I like the idea of the lower notes coming from below, as if they are coming from the earth, so
