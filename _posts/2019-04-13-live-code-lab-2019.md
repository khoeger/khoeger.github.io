postFooter: A post explaining the latest posting gap is in the works! It has been quite some time since I last posted, and posts I meant to post, like this brief writeup about Live Code Lab, were delayed.

Music Community Lab (MCL) put together a
[write-up](http://monthlymusichackathon.org/post/183904707222/live-code-lab-recap-resources)
of the events of Live Code Lab 2019, back in February.
This is just a brief synopsis of my experience.

## MCL Board Member Activities
As a board member, I was lucky enough to assist with event setup, errand running, check in, and photography.
I also go the chance to chat with volunteers, participants, and Dr. Adam Patrick Bell's research group, visiting from UCalgary.

## Workshops Attended
I often do not get to participate in workshops at MCL events.
This time, my fellow board members ensured that I got to participate!

I did not participate in the presentations at the end,
but have gotten to dabble here and there since the event.
Attending these workshops allowed me to broaden my Csound and python knowledge.

Both workshops started out similarly. We learned how to make a basic beat, added more and more on top of it, and were given pointers describing the different capabilities of each system and hints about how to learn more about both.

### Csound: Hexadecimal Beats
[Steven Yi](https://kunstmusik.com), currently a visiting assisting professor at RIT, presented [Hexidecimal Beats](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-live-code/blob/master/doc/hexadecimal_beats.md), his system for using hexadecimal notation to code in Csound. Basically, this system allows you to set what four 16th notes are doing with one keystroke. Coupled with the fact that Csound itself allows for highly customizable instruments, this allows for a very customizable live coding experience.

This system lends itself to 4 based meters easily.
Triplets, 32nd notes, and other rhythms can be introduced using lag.

To try this out, go to [live.csound.com](https://live.csound.com).
Steven created a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-live-code/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet.md) describing useful functions for the Hexadecimal beat system.
He also has a few [tutorials](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-live-code/tree/master/doc) and [references](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-live-code/blob/master/doc/reference.md) describing how to use Csound live.
If you want to try it yourself, I recommend starting with Tutorial 1,
which, while not specific to the hexadecimal technique,
gives you a lot of background on live.csound.com that you might otherwise be confused about.

While I am excited about getting better at using Csound live with hexadecimal beats,
you need to do some digging in the documents to learn how to do everything.
You can also watch some of Steven's live code sessions for tricks.

I have not yet gotten the hang of doing much that sounds interesting in Csound live,
but have high hopes of doing so in the future. Here is a demo to copy and paste into live.csound.com, which shows you what I can do so far!

#### Csound Live Code / Hexidecimal Beats Demo
Paste the example code into [live.csound.com](https://live.csound.com), paste it over all the code in the browser, highlight everything, and hit `cntrl-e` to run.

{% highlight csound %}
;; Select this code and press ctrl-e to evaluate
;; reset_clock()
set_tempo(100)
set_scale("maj")

;; callback instrument for csound-live-code
instr P1
  hexplay(	"1002",
      		"SD", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 0),
      		fade_in(7, 128) * ampdbfs(-12))
  hexplay(	"1111",
      		"BD", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 0),
      		fade_in(8, 128) * ampdbfs(-6))
  hexplay("1000",
      "0HH", p3,
      in_scale(-1, 0),
      fade_in(9, 128) * ampdbfs(-5))


  	hexplay("10000000",
      		"Sub5", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 1.5),
      		fade_in(11, 128) * ampdbfs(-12))
	hexplay("01000000",
      		"Sub5", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 0),
      		fade_in(11, 128) * ampdbfs(-12))
  hexplay(	"00200000",
      		"Sub5", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 1.5),
      		fade_in(11, 128) * ampdbfs(-12))
  hexplay(	"00020000",
      		"Sub5", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 2),
      		fade_in(11, 128) * ampdbfs(-12))
	hexplay("00001000",
      		"Sub5", p3,
      		in_scale(-1, 3.5),
      		fade_in(11, 128) * ampdbfs(-12))

endin

I was inspired by [Basin Street Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0nMHBFZc_E), and was trying create something similar in Csound Live Code. There is a ways to go.
