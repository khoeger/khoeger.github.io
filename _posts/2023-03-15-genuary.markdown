[Genuary](https://genuary.art) 2023, a month long creative coding challenge by and for generative artists,  came and went more than a month ago.  I participated for the first time this year. Still frames from my outputs for the year and reflections lie below.

## Reflections on Each Day
### 1 - Perfect loop / Infinite loop / endless GIFs
Truthfully, I only realized that Genuary had started once I started seeing the \#Genuary hashtags of my friends show up on Instagram and Twitter. So I missed day 1, and started on day 2. 
### 2 - Made in 10 minutes
![A grid 24 x 25 grid of pink and green squares. The first two rows of squares, plus the first 2 columns of the third row, are pink. The rest of the squares are green. At the top of the square, there is a header that shows that the image is a screenshot from a p5js webeditor. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_2.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
The still shown is from a that is a 10 minute timer, or, in other terms, a visualization of 10 minutes.
I interpreted the prompt as "the end image should be made in 10 minutes". 
If a viewer is patient enough, they can use the grid as a timer for 10 minutes. Additionally, a viewer can look at the grid, and see that any grid made took 10 minutes to generate. 

I attempted to finish the code in 10 minutes. 
The bare bones of the code were finished in 10 minutes, but  a lot of debugging, and all commenting, happened after the work completed.
### 3 - Glitch Art
![A grey banister on a black background, hard to identify banister. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_3.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}
A still from a short animation of light changing on the stairway. 

One of the easiest ways for me to generate glitches is to try out a new library. 
Therefore, as I am working on taking video as input for long term projects, I decided to try taking image from my web camera, and see what sorts of glitchy results I could force. 

### 4 - Intersections
![A  lattice structure of pink, with smaller lattice structures of yellow inside, and black and teal backgrounds. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_4.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
This still is taken from a set of rotating lines. 

Lines that cross, intersect. 
Lines of various thickness and colors generate various patterns. 
This exploration was inspired by Scottish tartans.

This particular exploration ran slowly, but worked well to generate still to form into an animation. 
If I wanted to run this in real time, I would need to look into another method of generating lines, instead of making line classes and storing them in memory.
Perhaps I would use shaders. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that when creating work that takes 10 minutes to create, you need to wait 10 minutes to test it.
Therefore, even if the code is simple, it is a time consuming project, and will by nature expand past the 10 minute deadline implied by the prompt. 
Creating this work required lots of waiting. 
### 5 - Debug view
![Black circles on a white background, next to rainbow colored short lines, distributed like straws across the image. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_5.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

Once again, this is a still from an animation. 
In the animation, black rings bounce around the white canvas. 
Where the rings collide, a rainbow colored line is drawn perpendicular to the edges that touch. 
The lines fade over time, leaving a trace of collisions in the near past, but not showing a complete history of collisions. 

On the 5th day, I began to reign in my ambition, and tried to stick to minimal interpertations of the prompts unless they fit my future ambitions for personal projects.
I found that I was spending a bit too much time on prompts, enforcing unhealthy habits and not being present in life. 
### 6 - Steal Like An Artist
![A staircase with the outline of an invisible figure going down it.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_6.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
This is a still from a video depicting the outline of a person descending a staircase. 
This work uses the code from day 3, glitch art, as a base, and takes inspiration from Marcel DuChamp's [Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2)](https://philamuseum.org/collection/object/51449).

The code for this day was rather quick. 
However, the number of takes it took to get an acceptable recording exceeded the amount of time I put aside. 
Also, it required having an assistant, something I had not taken into account when I planed the sketch. 
### 7 - Sample from your favorite album cover
![A grey background with words in a distinctive, angular font placed randomly across the the surface, layered. The words are in shades of grey and red.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_7.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This image is one of many meant to be generated by the program I wrote on day 7. 
The code takes design cues from Metallica's "Live Shit: Binge & Purge" album. 
Text is taken from the cover, as is the color scheme and color proportions, font, and style. 

While this cover has less polite language than what I tend to use and is not the prettiest, I chose it because of the music. 
I do not tend to evaluate movies or albums by how aesthetically pleasing I find them, but by how much of the movie or album I enjoy. 
This is an album that I believe has solid musical choices. 
Therefore, I learned that while the prompts tend to be skewed visually, my gut instinct is not to remember visually impressive covers. 

This was a sane decision for a day's code. 
This prompt did not take up more time than expected, as all of the steps involved in generating the result were relatively simple and built off of code that I had used recently. 

### 8 - Signed Distance Functions
![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_8.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

I decided to interpret signed distance functions by defining an inner region and an outer region, and only plotting points within the inner region. 
To make the results more interesting, I layered regions within regions. 
Circles are plotted when randomly chosen spots fall within the region defined by the boundaries of the hexagon. 
This reminded me of the catch the falling apple or owl catching accorn assignment from the teaching at the Digital Arts Experiece (which is sadly gone, the pandemic killed it) or UMaine's New Media 105 course. 
There may have been more computationally efficient implementations (see [Piter Pasma's](https://genuary.art/wtsdf), [Inigo Quilezles's 2D](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/), and [Inigo Quilezles's 3D](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/) explanations) but I definitely went with what I knew, rather than learning a new technique, due to time constraints. 

### 9 - Plants
![A green background with a purple flower composed of dots in front.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_9.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This image was composed using a mix of the 10 minute technique from Day 2 and the pixel sampling process I use in reconstituted Media. 
The plant shown is from a picture I took while visiting the [Jardin botanique de Montréal](https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden) in 2018. 

This response is also part of the exploratory phase of a potential larger project that I have started laying the groundwork for. 
I began to develop the idea during Genuary.
Basically, the idea is to create a project that shows my progress.
At the moment, I feel like I am treading water. 
I definitely am completing many tasks, but sometimes progress is hard to see. 
The goal is to make the progress easier to recognize. 

### 10 - Generative music
![Colorful circles of different colors randomly placed on a white background.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_10.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

Music is meant to be heard. 
This work was inspired by a favorite flute piece I have practiced as well as an aleatoric music project from my undergraduate years. 
The sounds generated are basic sine tones, in pitches and durations given by the pitches and durations of [Giulio Briccialdi's "Il Carnevale di Venezia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5olg5OGiaQc)." 
The melody is also one I heard as a child, in the form of "Mein Hut, der Hat Drei Ecken."
The visuals, colorful balls, are a still from an animation. 
As the balls bounce into one another, they trigger the next note, pitch and duration are chosen based off of the probabilities from Briccialdi's flute score. 
Colors correspond with pitch, radius with duration.
Transition probabilities were hand tallied.

### 11 - Suprematism
![Black, yellow, and purple rectangles are on an off white background. Purple and white circles are also placed on the screen. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_11.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

Exploring suprematism required bold colors, standard shapes, reduced color palletes and shapes, and not having a specific visual to imply. 
Off whites were important. 
I chose purple and yellow, even though the examples shown did not use them, as I did not understand why the example works strayed away from these colors. 
I used pseudo random numbers to generated outputs similar to examples found on various websites showing pictures of Suprematism and describing how to create similar images. 
The outputs were animations, and the pictured visual is a still from them. 

This result felt bold and was a project that allowed me to work on more than the daily genuary prompt. I enjoyed learning about a Russian art movement of the 20th century that I had not heard of prior to this. 
I did not figure out how it translated into the medium of sound. 

### 12 - Tessellation
![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_12.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

I build this pattern slowly. 
First, I constructed a tile.
I repeated the tile across the page.
After I had a basic repeating tile, I added one element at a time to create the pattern. 
When I have created tiled patterns in the past, I created a tile first, and then made a repeating pattern across the screen.  
This result is more cohesive / harder to find the beginnings and ends of, than some of my past patterns. 

Once again, I threw efficiency of code out the window in favor of efficiency in time spent writing code. 
### 13 - I've always wanted to learn
