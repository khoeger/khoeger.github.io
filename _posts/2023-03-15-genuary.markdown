[Genuary](https://genuary.art) 2023, a month long creative coding challenge by and for generative artists,  came and went more than a month ago.  I participated for the first time this year. Still frames from my outputs for the year and reflections lie below.

## Reflections on Each Day
### 1 - Perfect loop / Infinite loop / endless GIFs
Truthfully, I only realized that Genuary had started once I started seeing the \#Genuary hashtags of my friends show up on Instagram and Twitter. So I missed day 1, and started on day 2. 
### 2 - Made in 10 minutes
![A grid 24 x 25 grid of pink and green squares. The first two rows of squares, plus the first 2 columns of the third row, are pink. The rest of the squares are green. At the top of the square, there is a header that shows that the image is a screenshot from a p5js webeditor. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_2.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
The still shown is from a that is a 10 minute timer, or, in other terms, a visualization of 10 minutes.
I interpreted the prompt as "the end image should be made in 10 minutes". 
If a viewer is patient enough, they can use the grid as a timer for 10 minutes. Additionally, a viewer can look at the grid, and see that any grid made took 10 minutes to generate. 

I attempted to finish the code in 10 minutes. 
The bare bones of the code were finished in 10 minutes, but  a lot of debugging, and all commenting, happened after the work completed.
### 3 - Glitch Art
![A grey banister on a black background, hard to identify banister. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_3.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}
A still from a short animation of light changing on the stairway. 

One of the easiest ways for me to generate glitches is to try out a new library. 
Therefore, as I am working on taking video as input for long term projects, I decided to try taking image from my web camera, and see what sorts of glitchy results I could force. 

### 4 - Intersections
![A  lattice structure of pink, with smaller lattice structures of yellow inside, and black and teal backgrounds. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_4.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
This still is taken from a set of rotating lines. 

Lines that cross, intersect. 
Lines of various thickness and colors generate various patterns. 
This exploration was inspired by Scottish tartans.

This particular exploration ran slowly, but worked well to generate still to form into an animation. 
If I wanted to run this in real time, I would need to look into another method of generating lines, instead of making line classes and storing them in memory.
Perhaps I would use shaders. 
### 5 - Debug view
![Black circles on a white background, next to rainbow colored short lines, distributed like straws across the image. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_5.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

Once again, this is a still from an animation. 
In the animation, black rings bounce around the white canvas. 
Where the rings collide, a rainbow colored line is drawn perpendicular to the edges that touch. 
The lines fade over time, leaving a trace of collisions in the near past, but not showing a complete history of collisions. 

On the 5th day, I began to reign in my ambition, and tried to stick to minimal interpertations of the prompts unless they fit my future ambitions for personal projects.
I found that I was spending a bit too much time on prompts, enforcing unhealthy habits and not being present in life.
