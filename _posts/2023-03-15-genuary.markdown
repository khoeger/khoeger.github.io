[Genuary](https://genuary.art) 2023, a month long creative coding challenge by and for generative artists,  came and went more than a month ago.  I participated for the first time this year. Still frames from my outputs for the year and reflections lie below.

## Reflections on Each Day
### 1 - Perfect loop / Infinite loop / endless GIFs

Non-existant. I started on day 2. Seeing [this ⊕ that](https://www.instagram.com/_thisxorthat/)'s day 1 reel jogged my memory.

### 2 - Made in 10 minutes

![A grid 24 x 25 grid of pink and green squares. The first two rows of squares, plus the first 2 columns of the third row, are pink. The rest of the squares are green. At the top of the square, there is a header that shows that the image is a screenshot from a p5js webeditor. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_2.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
What does it mean to be "made in 10 minutes?" 
It can mean that after a system has been running for 10 minutes, the image you see has been made in that time frame. 
I chose to attempt this, in a method that made the progression of time easy to understand.
The image shown depicts a still from the process, 10 minutes and 52 seconds after the first green square was laid down.

### 3 - Glitch Art

![A grey banister on a black background, hard to identify banister. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_3.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}
A still from a short animation of light changing on the stairway. 

One of the easiest ways for me to generate glitches is to try out a new library. 
Therefore, as I am working on taking video as input for long term projects, I decided to try taking image from my web camera, and see what sorts of glitchy results I could force. 

### 4 - Intersections

![A  lattice structure of pink, with smaller lattice structures of yellow inside, and black and teal backgrounds. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_4.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
This still is taken from a set of rotating lines. 

Lines that cross, intersect. 
Lines of various thickness and colors generate various patterns. 
This exploration was inspired by Scottish tartans.

This particular exploration ran slowly, but worked well to generate still to form into an animation. 
If I wanted to run this in real time, I would need to look into another method of generating lines, instead of making line classes and storing them in memory.
Perhaps I would use shaders. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that when creating work that takes 10 minutes to create, you need to wait 10 minutes to test it.
Therefore, even if the code is simple, it is a time consuming project, and will by nature expand past the 10 minute deadline implied by the prompt. 
Creating this work required lots of waiting. 
### 5 - Debug view

![Black circles on a white background, next to rainbow colored short lines, distributed like straws across the image. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_5.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

Once again, this is a still from an animation. 
In the animation, black rings bounce around the white canvas. 
Where the rings collide, a rainbow colored line is drawn perpendicular to the edges that touch. 
The lines fade over time, leaving a trace of collisions in the near past, but not showing a complete history of collisions. 

On the 5th day, I began to reign in my ambition, and tried to stick to minimal interpertations of the prompts unless they fit my future ambitions for personal projects.
I found that I was spending a bit too much time on prompts, enforcing unhealthy habits and not being present in life. 
### 6 - Steal Like An Artist

![A staircase with the outline of an invisible figure going down it.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_6.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
This is a still from a video depicting the outline of a person descending a staircase. 
This work uses the code from day 3, glitch art, as a base, and takes inspiration from Marcel DuChamp's [Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2)](https://philamuseum.org/collection/object/51449).

The code for this day was rather quick. 
However, the number of takes it took to get an acceptable recording exceeded the amount of time I put aside. 
Also, it required having an assistant, something I had not taken into account when I planed the sketch. 
### 7 - Sample from your favorite album cover

![A grey background with words in a distinctive, angular font placed randomly across the the surface, layered. The words are in shades of grey and red.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_7.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This image is one of many meant to be generated by the program I wrote on day 7. 
The code takes design cues from Metallica's "Live Shit: Binge & Purge" album. 
Text is taken from the cover, as is the color scheme and color proportions, font, and style. 

While this cover has less polite language than what I tend to use and is not the prettiest, I chose it because of the music. 
I do not tend to evaluate movies or albums by how aesthetically pleasing I find them, but by how much of the movie or album I enjoy. 
This is an album that I believe has solid musical choices. 
Therefore, I learned that while the prompts tend to be skewed visually, my gut instinct is not to remember visually impressive covers. 

This was a sane decision for a day's code. 
This prompt did not take up more time than expected, as all of the steps involved in generating the result were relatively simple and built off of code that I had used recently. 

### 8 - Signed Distance Functions

![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_8.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

I decided to interpret signed distance functions by defining an inner region and an outer region, and only plotting points within the inner region. 
To make the results more interesting, I layered regions within regions. 
Circles are plotted when randomly chosen spots fall within the region defined by the boundaries of the hexagon. 
This reminded me of the catch the falling apple or owl catching accorn assignment from the teaching at the Digital Arts Experiece (which is sadly gone, the pandemic killed it) or UMaine's New Media 105 course. 
There may have been more computationally efficient implementations (see [Piter Pasma's](https://genuary.art/wtsdf), [Inigo Quilezles's 2D](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/), and [Inigo Quilezles's 3D](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/) explanations) but I definitely went with what I knew, rather than learning a new technique, due to time constraints. 

### 9 - Plants

![A green background with a purple flower composed of dots in front.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_9.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This image was composed using a mix of the 10 minute technique from Day 2 and the pixel sampling process I use in reconstituted Media. 
The plant shown is from a picture I took while visiting the [Jardin botanique de Montréal](https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/botanical-garden) in 2018. 

This response is also part of the exploratory phase of a potential larger project that I have started laying the groundwork for. 
I began to develop the idea during Genuary.
Basically, the idea is to create a project that shows my progress.
At the moment, I feel like I am treading water. 
I definitely am completing many tasks, but sometimes progress is hard to see. 
The goal is to make the progress easier to recognize. 

### 10 - Generative music

![Colorful circles of different colors randomly placed on a white background.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_10.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

Music is meant to be heard. 
This work was inspired by a favorite flute piece I have practiced as well as an aleatoric music project from my undergraduate years. 
The sounds generated are basic sine tones, in pitches and durations given by the pitches and durations of [Giulio Briccialdi's "Il Carnevale di Venezia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5olg5OGiaQc)." 
The melody is also one I heard as a child, in the form of "Mein Hut, der Hat Drei Ecken."
The visuals, colorful balls, are a still from an animation. 
As the balls bounce into one another, they trigger the next note, pitch and duration are chosen based off of the probabilities from Briccialdi's flute score. 
Colors correspond with pitch, radius with duration.
Transition probabilities were hand tallied.

### 11 - Suprematism

![Black, yellow, and purple rectangles are on an off white background. Purple and white circles are also placed on the screen. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_11.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

Exploring suprematism required bold colors, standard shapes, reduced color palletes and shapes, and not having a specific visual to imply. 
Off whites were important. 
I chose purple and yellow, even though the examples shown did not use them, as I did not understand why the example works strayed away from these colors. 
I used pseudo random numbers to generated outputs similar to examples found on various websites showing pictures of Suprematism and describing how to create similar images. 
The outputs were animations, and the pictured visual is a still from them. 

This result felt bold and was a project that allowed me to work on more than the daily genuary prompt. I enjoyed learning about a Russian art movement of the 20th century that I had not heard of prior to this. 
I did not figure out how it translated into the medium of sound. 

### 12 - Tessellation

![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_12.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

I build this pattern slowly. 
First, I constructed a tile.
I repeated the tile across the page.
After I had a basic repeating tile, I added one element at a time to create the pattern. 
When I have created tiled patterns in the past, I created a tile first, and then made a repeating pattern across the screen.  
This result is more cohesive / harder to find the beginnings and ends of, than some of my past patterns. 

Once again, I threw efficiency of code out the window in favor of efficiency in time spent writing code. 

### 13 - I've always wanted to learn

![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_13.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

This photo depicts a still showing hardware I wish to use in the future. 
I spent the time I had set aside for the prompt preparing code to show on this display. 
Why did I work on this? 
My visuals are often digital, and I feel a need to present them easily. 
When this system is fully functional, I should just be able to pass someone this display, and would be able to see and interact with my work after plugging it in. 

### 14 - Aesemic

![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_14.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}
Asemic writing looks like writing but does not have meaning.

Writing belongs to specific peoples, with their own cultures and practices, and is used to communicate information between groups and store the information for personal memory and posterity. 
Therefore, to create writing that looks like written language, but is not, my first step was to consider some of the tenets the memebers of the society follow. 

This society believes in building from the ground up, starting at the very bottom, and moving in the direction one does not walk automatically.
Therefore, 
this language is written from bottom left to upper right. 
It also does not use closed curves. 
There are spaces and stopping characters built into the generated image. 

### 15 - Sine waves

![Small black wrings arranged in a shape that looks like a sideways goblet, on a white background. The rings are in curved lines and rows.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_15.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

Sine, or \\f(x) = (Sine(x)\\) is an important function in mathematics, physics, and engineering. 
It is also important when creating digitally generated visuals on a computer.
It has many computationally nice properties, such as the following: 
- \\(Sin\\) is a periodic function. 
This means that \\(Sin(x)=y\\) is not unique --- there are many values \\(x_i, x_j\\), where \\(i \neq j\\) such that \\(Sin(x_i) = y\\) and is \\(Sin(x_j)= y\\) as well. The entire Sine function repeats after a fixed period. 
- The vaulues output from the Sine function are bounded between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). 
- The outputs of Sine repeat, and are also bound between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). Therefore, if we want to make an image that repeats itself over time, making the image change with respect to the Sine function is a convenient way to do so. 

The image generated is a still from an animation that shows how, given the properties of Sine mentioned, the output of the Sine function varies over time given a range of inputs from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\). 
### 16 - Reflection of a reflection
![4 comet-like shapes, one in each corner, all facing inward. The top right is the darkest. the bottom left is the lightest, the top left and bottom right are in between. The shapes are shades of grey, on white, and composed of overlaping ciricles. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_16.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

Common reflections in a Cartesian coordinate system include reflections over the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes. 
In real life, reflections in succesive mirros get slightly smaller over time, and eventually fade out of view. 
In this interpretation of reflection, the mouse's position on the screen, mapped to the upper right corner of the image, is reflected across the axes until all quadrants are filled. 
With each successive reflection, the image fades. 

The image shown is from a still taken during a session of moving the mouse through the finished daily exploration.
### 17 - A grid inside a grid inside a grid 
![Pink circles, squares, and triangles, laid out in various overlapping grids.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_17.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

In [Yusuke's Genuary Day 4](https://twitter.com/ysk_cc/status/1610599570131779584), he laid 3 grids on top of one another and created patterns. This inspired me to lay grids where the intersections were various shapes on top of one another, and rotate them. 
The still pictured is from the animation showing the rotation of the overlapping grids of shapes. 

### 18 - Definitely not a grid
![Dots forming circles, radiating out from the center of each side of the square, overlapping one another.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_18.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This image is formed of dots, placed in sucessively larger cirlces. 
The overlapping circles look like the form a grid, similar to what is used ot create orthographic projections. 
However, none of the shapes formed by the overlapping circles are squares or rectangles. 

The image shown is a still from the animation which showed the progression of placing dots one at a time to form the created pattern.
### 19 - Black and white
![A black, white, and green speckled circle on a white background.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_19.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
The terms "black and white" are weighty and related to much strife in American history. 
As a "mixed-race" person, specifically as a "Black" person with more ancestors who would have been deemed "White" than any other race, I decided to see what would happen if I created a graphic that depicted my ancestry as a conglomeration of the ancestries of my great, great, great, grandparents, who would have been classified as either "White", "Black", or "Other" (I represented other with green, as while the Native American ).

This is a still from an animation, showing the background sliding from white to black and back and again repeatedly. 
### 20 - Art Deco

![A grid of teal tiles with yellow and red arches.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_20.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This entry was inspired by the arches on the Chrysler building, as well as bold and rich colors I associate with the roaring 20s.  
The image draws from associations from a childhood visiting NYC and years of exposure to 20s themed events due to a combiation of playing in swing bands and attending swing dance events. 

### 21 - Persian Rug

![A green rug shape with white, pink, and yellow shpaes sprea across it.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_21.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
Persian rugs have strong colors, multiple overlaying patterns, and often have a strong central shape. 
The shapes and patterns chosen were chosen to mimic the shapes from existing rugs. 
The patterns on this digital rug are mobile, which is not evident from the still shown here. 


### 22 - Shadows
![A black background with hundreds of circles arranged in the shape of a sideways goblet. Ther circles range from teal to pink, some have both colors on them.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_22.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

There are no shadows without light. 
When multiple colored lights are used, the shadws that appear will be shadows in a mix of the colors used. 
The Sine prompt was reused, to create a field of moving spheres in 3D. 
As the spheres move, the shadows change. 
As 3 colored lights are used, the shadows change according to motion and light position, and the spheres are different not only because of location, but also because of the shadows and lights on them.

### 23 - More Moiré
![A purple flower on a green background, composed of many parallel lines. ]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_23.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}
The process from the Reconstituted Media Project's image constrution was used to create this image. 
To fit the prompt, the brush became multiple parallel lines. 
As the brush is placed randomly, different brushstrokes will overlap, giving multiple overlapping parallel lines in often similar colors, giving a moiré effect.

### 24 - Textile
![A grey background wiht many stitched rabbits connected by tread.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_24.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

This embroidery pattern, which can be printed and used with an embroidery machine, depicts stitched red rabbits in celebration of the year of the rabbit.

### 25 - Yayoi Kusama
![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_25.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

### 26 - My kid could have made that

### 28 - Generative poetry
![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_28.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

### 29 - Maximalism
![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_29.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

### 30 - Minimalism
![A black background with hundreds of overlapping purple rings forming a hexagon.]({{"assets//img/2023//03//genuary//genuary_30.png" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-right}

### 31 - Break a previous images
