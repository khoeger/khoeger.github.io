Fall 2017 was a great season for me as a performer. Here's a list of the performances I was fortunate enough to participate in.

## Limpe Fuch's Workshop Ensemble
### *Sunday, October 8, 2017*
**Prismatic Park, Madison Sqare Garden, New York, NY**

Participants from the week of hour-long workshops played various instruments alongside the visiting instrument creator, [Limpe Fuchs](http://www.limpefuchs.de/en/). At various points of the performance, I played my flute, at others, I played her instruments. The performance was purely improvisation based, and relied heavily on communicating with other participants and listening to the atypical tuning to create interesting harmonies.

Thank you, [Blank Forms](https://blankforms.org), for sponsoring this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
