postFooter: Doesn't the cake in the photo look delicious? Let me know if you want the cake recipe! (Or just decoration instructions). It was a variation of a layered, gluten free angel cake, and was delicious. Truthfully, it hasn't been perfected. I need to tweak it a bit more before I will be satisfied.

A lot has changed in my life over the last couple of months.
Here's a brief run down of what has occupied my time when I took a slight
hiatus from updating my site.
Some of it was great, but other parts, not so much.

For the most part,
I attended the events I said I would,
and even attended a few others.
I will update my blog to reflect this.

## Graduate School Applications
I applied to graduate programs!
It is a goal of mine to create a life for myself where I can make
creative music/sound based experiences as part of my career.
I believe going to graduate school will help me on that path.

Submitting my applications helped me realize some of the ways I need to revamp
my web presence to reflect my artistic work better.
If you see many changes over the next few months, this is why.
Feel free to let me know what you think.

## Accepting Graduate School Offer
Next fall, I will be a graduate student at [University of Maine](https://umaine.edu), in Orono, ME.
I accepted a place in UMaine's [Intermedia](intermedia.umaine.edu/) Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) program.
I am extremely excited about the chance to expand my artistry,
and develop a sustainable practice as an artist utilizing sound!

## Death of a Friend
Sadly, not everything in life has been as if seen through rose-tinted glasses.
One of my best friends from college,
[Chance Crompton](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/saltlaketribune/obituary.aspx?n=jonathan-chance-crompton&pid=191794012&fbclid=IwAR186SWwW4lpDej4NJyDvdN_Nri5GJMA9anEDBfNaqULf0gzR0cuLVy9NHE), died.
I have been slowly working towards normalcy in life since hearing the news.
