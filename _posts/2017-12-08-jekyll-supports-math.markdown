I am writing this blog using Jekyll.
The [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/) notes that there is a way to make your blog render mathematics notation.
In following posts, I will find this very useful, so today, I shall implement [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). Perhaps, in the future, I can find a way to render music nicely too?

I have decided to fllow allong with Gaston Sanchez's blog pos on using [MathJax with Jekyll](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/).
