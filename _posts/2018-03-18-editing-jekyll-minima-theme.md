Minima's great, but everyone's blog looked like mine. So, I decide to follow along with the Learn Enough Society's [tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial?single_page=1#code-post-start), in hopes of creating a more interesting looking blog.

I needed a sample post while following along with it. While I have many posts already, I'm using this one as the post that I can compare specifically with their example.

For the tutorial, we pull a image of a cat from online. While they used an `Html` method, I've used the standard `Liquid` way.

![kitten]({{ "http://placekitten.com/g/400/200" | absolute_url }}){: .pull-left}

Ta-da! I can continue on with the tutorial.
