Minima's great, but everyone's blog looked like mine. So, I decide to follow along with the Learn Enough Society tutorials, in hopes of creating a more interesting looking blog.

I needed a sample post while following along with Learn Enough Society's [tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial?single_page=1#code-post-start).

We'll add another image of a cat below, pulled from online.
![kitten]("http://placekitten.com/g/400/200").

Ta-da! I can continue on with the tutorial
