[University of Maine's Digital Curation](https://digitalcuration.umaine.edu/) program hosted a webinar titled "Decentering the Web: From Platforms to Protocols"
today at 11:00 AM EST. Jon Ippolito and John Bell were the hosts.
The panelists were Glen Weyl and Mike Maizels.
Please note that the below are my thoughts, scribbled notes, or impressions,
and I encourage verification of content before acting upon anything.

The conversation started off with an overview of the current shift from Web 2.0
to Web 3.0.
[Web 2.0 platforms](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Web-20) such as Twitter and Facebook work off of having connected users, social dynamics, and interactive pages.<sup>[0],[1]</sup>
However, they are also controlled by individual parties (Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg), and therefore, the actions and decisions of the controlling parties
effect the end experiences and social connections between users.<sup>[0]</sup>
[Web 3.0](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-web-3-0/)
makes use of decentralization, having users interact with each other without
large corporations as the moderator controlling the interactions.<sup>[0],[2]</sup>
Blockchain technology is purportedly used to facilitate these "peer-to-peer" interactions without oversight of large corporations or specific individuals who have large control over all of the stakes.<sup>[0],[2]</sup>
Weyl argued that blockchain technology is a way to create shared cultural understanding.<sup>[0]</sup>
[Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/nft-non-fungible-token/) are "digital assets" - they are bought and sold digital records that make it easier to track ownership or verify authenticity because they are powered by blockchain technology.<sup>[0],[2]</sup>

The major topics discuss then ranged from if and how blockchain technologies could be used to help individuals trust spread information,
how authenticity and blockchain trust worthiness are established,
truth as established by a crowd vs through institutions,
using distributed systems to challenge, replace, or encourage the improvement of centralized systems,
the inherent inequalities developing in a system where those with better funding and technology are able to establish stronger records of authenticity before the less fortunate, if the systems are customizable to local decision making and verification needs,
and about how the lack of regional or ecological correlations in the system can be an asset.
