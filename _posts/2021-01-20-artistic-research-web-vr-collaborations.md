Amidst the craze of the pandemic and election art life and university life went on. I made projects, learned about research in art and experiments in art, led a lab section, and formed a few opinions about creating collaborative work.

## Projects

### Web VR
I created **Mirrored Affirmations** and **It Happened This Year** in an attempt to bring the gallery experience to the experiencer as the experiencer is reluctant to physically enter galleries during the pandemic. It was a project created with the Critique course in mind.

#### **Mirrored Affirmations**, 2020

Web Virtual Reality for computer with webcam

*Materials:* A-frame, glitch, photos, video, webcam feed, 3d models

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/mirrored-affirmations?path=README.md&previewSize=100"
    alt="mirrored-affirmations on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

**Mirrored Affirmations**, above, contains the beginnings of an exploration of wallpaper groups and the beginnings of an exploration into web virtual reality which includes the viewer through the use of a camera.
It is heavily dependent on technology and internet.
You cannot experience the full piece on a phone. This piece uses a-frame as this site uses markdown, basically as a markup language.

See a video walkthrough below to get a peak into the full experience.

#### **It Happened This Year**, 2020

Web Virtual Reality and Commemoration

*Materials:* A-frame, glitch, JavaScript, photos, story submissions

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/it-happened-this-year?path=README.md&previewSize=100"
    title="it-happened-this-year on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

**It Happened This Year** documents the past year from the perspective of participants.
Each participant contributes a story that gets commemorated via a digital wall.
The stories spread out to form a dynamic city like landscape that a visitor can navigate through.
This experience is dependent on visitor input, internet, and navigation tools such as a keyboard.
You cannot experience the full piece on a phone.

This piece uses a combination of A-frame and JavaScript.
A-frame creates the figures.
Javscript is responsible for the duplication and placement of the figures.

See the video walkthrough below to get a peak into the full experience.

### THOUGHTS ON WEB VR
Web VR projects require a lot of time and review of web coding skills I only use on occasion. That being said if one were to work consistently on one project for a couple of months in this platform and knew JavaScript I expect they could create a fully functional VR environment that works on computer as well as on a VR headset, complete with sound, interactions, and a database.

Web VR is an exciting addition to my potential display methods because it creates a feeling of space without me needing to actually set aside space for an exhibit.
It allows me to add to the collection progressively with relatively little effort and should insure that the project can grow to epic proportions.
Computer generation allows each person's experience to be different by virtue of easily rearranging the content which gives the content itself equal weight.
Use of code allows easy consistent formatting of the exhibit.

One of the biggest hurdles I found was the accessibility of my project to my audience.
Not everyone has a powerful modern computer or a consistent enough internet to participate in the experience.
More easily collected user input, such as streaming video, requires a user to understand how to set up their system to allow for streaming.  
More intensive user input, such as asking for written stories, requires strong enough user interest that they carry through with providing a narrative to you.

There are some technical hurdles as well.
First of all for a unique experience I need to build everything myself. 
This is a time consuming endeavor.
Checking to see if the code works the same way on multiple browsers and operating systems is also difficult during the pandemic.
Implementing sound for the web virtual reality experience while also creating a dynamic site without a budget is currently a roadblock for me.
So is implementing a database.
Implementing everything to a high standard in less than a month while working on multiple other projects is very challenging.
In short, at the moment, this is not yet a very useable substitute for me for an in person gallery experience.
With time and diligent experimentation it may become so.
