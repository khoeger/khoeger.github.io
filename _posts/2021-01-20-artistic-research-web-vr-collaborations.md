Amidst the craze of the pandemic and election art life and university life went on. I made projects, learned about research in art and experiments in art, led a lab section, and formed a few opinions about creating collaborative work.

## Projects

### Web VR
I created **Mirrored Affirmations** and **It Happened Last Year** in an attempt to bring the gallery experience to the experiencer as the experiencer is reluctant to physically enter galleries during the pandemic. It was created as part of the

**Mirrored Affirmations**, above, contains the beginnings of an exploration of wallpaper groups and the beginnings of an exploration into web virtual reality which includes the viewer through the use of a camera.
It is heavily dependent on technology and internet.
You cannot experience the full piece on a phone. This piece uses a-frame as this site uses markdown, basically as a markup language.

See a video walkthrough below to get a peak into the full experience.

#### Thoughts on Web VR
Web VR projects require a lot of time and review of web coding skills I only use on occasion. That being said if one were to work consistently on one project for a couple of months in this platform and knew JavaScript I expect they could create a fully functional VR environment that works on computer as well as on a VR headset, complete with sound, interactions, and a database.
