Something moves. [[1]](#soundphysics)
This object's motion get's transmitted through a medium. The vibration caused by the motion travels through the medium the form of a wave. The wave hits your body, your body processes information from it, and, if the original wave meets the correct conditions, you hear a sound.

What exactly happens so that we can hear sounds and understand things about their origins?

## How do we process sounds?
For humans to hear an externally produced sound, the information from a sound wave needs to make its way inside the body to be processed. Let's consider how sound travels through one ear.

### One Ear
Sounds are funneled into the body after hitting the outer ear. [[2]](#soundpath) The waves pass through the ear canal and vibrate the eardrum, which sets off a Rube-Goldberg Machine like set of reactions inside the ear. In this way, vibrations pass into the inner reaches of the inner ear's cochlea. While there, they trigger an electrical signal that is carried to the brain, where it is processed as a sound we understand.

For a more in depth description of the process, check out [How We Hear](http://www.betterhearing.org/hearingpedia/how-we-hear).

Next, we consider how we can tell where sound is coming from.
