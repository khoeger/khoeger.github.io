From September 9 - 24, I was an [Artist in Residence at Bethany Arts Community](https://bethanyarts.org/residencies/fall-residency-2022/) in Ossining, NY.
This post features select reflections from this amazing first residency experience.
Thank you for the opportunity, Bethany Arts Community.
Thank you for the companionship in the experience, fellow artists in residence.

### Work Produced
I iterated on my Reconstituted Media project at while at Bethany.
I spent a sizeable portion of the time considering what topics might be well captured with a process that places down bits of color sequentially to form images, or a process that builds up sounds from smaller components.
During this two week residency period, I focused on using picture inputs and visually generated outputs.
I stuck to source imagery relevant to Bethany and it's local environment, pictures I took while wandering around the city of Ossining during my stay.

[Show Generated Image / Initial Image Pairs]

After generating multiple separate images, I realized that my memories of the locations overlapped.
Therefore, I tweaked the code to start generating images that overlap.
Just as I can wander from location to location and have a hard time isolating any of the images as the sights I saw while in Ossining, an observer sees the same.

The video below shows one iteration through generating some of the pictures.
The code I worked on while at Bethany Arts Community, the code to generate this sequence of images, can be found on my [github's Reconstituted Media project.](https://github.com/khoeger/explorationOfComputerPointillism/tree/main/refactor_switchThroughShapes/oneReconstituedImage_nImages) (The Reconstituted Media project was once erroneously titled Computer Pointillism).

I wanted to figure out how to display this work.
Originally, I thought of creating a book to show still versions of the generated images.
However, I believe the most interesting part of the work is really in watching the generated images grow,
 and in the visual forms that can be observed as various images layer upon each other in different ways.
Therefore, I tried projecting the results.
The projections did not do justice to the walking and travelling involved in traversing a city.
Therefore, the results are, as of yet, not displayed.
The display is a work in progress, hopefully coming soon!

### Workshop

As part of the residency, Bethany Arts Community offered each artist in Resident the opportunity to deliver a workshop.
I gave a workshop entitled [Generated Images of Ossining](https://bethanyarts.org/calendar/katarina-hoeger/).
I worked with local high school students and members of the Bethany Arts Community as part of a workshop at the Joseph G. Caputo Community Center.
We took images, and generated constantly shifting dot images in p5js, following a procedure very similar to Dan Shiffman's example [15-14 from "Learning Processing: The Nature Of Code"](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp15/example-15-14-Pointillism).
