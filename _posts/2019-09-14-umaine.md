September 3rd marked my first day as an [Intermedia MFA](https://intermedia.umaine.edu/mfa-program/) graduate student at the University of Maine. This is an exciting new adventure that will, in some parts, be documented through this website.

I joined the Intermedia program in an effort to solidify my artistic practice, create many new pieces, which may relate to sound, and to learn to approach life as an artist. My current portfolio focuses mostly on sound and musical arts. I am curious to see where my future takes me.

I have a Graduate Assistantship at the University of Maine [Hackerspace](umaine.edu/hackerspace/). It is a technology resource for students on campus where I assist students in their journeys to become more self-sufficient with technology, no matter their majors.
