Welcome to my blog!

I plan to use this blog to keep a public record of any music, mathematics, operations research, computer science, music technology, or other topics I explore. It will also double as a normal blog.

The first tech related issue to discuss is actually blog creation! Last Monday was Cyber Monday, and I decided to celebrate it by buying a cheap domain name and DNS from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com). It took a little while, but now this blog is up and running.
