*Relevant current events at time of writing include the [2020 coronavirus pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0646-z) and the social justice momentum sparked by [George Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)'s and [Breonna Taylor](https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html)'s deaths and [Christain Cooper](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/nyregion/amy-cooper-christian-central-park-video.html)'s central park bird watching related harassment.*


## motivations and organization

This post is for you, my family, friends, and acquaintances who have reached out recently because you want to know how I am.
I am exhausted and want to speak with each of you individually, but do not have the bandwidth.

Why don't I have the bandwidth? After all,
I consider many of you to be close friends.
You may have noticed, I like spending time communicating with others in moderation, but am not an extrovert and am not a great communicator.
I have learned to be a bit of a loner, find social media stressful, and am always juggling too much. If I reach out to you a few times a year, have ever sent you mail, or have semi-consistently reached out to you over a span of years, congratulations, you are close.
This is also for all of you who were once close, are just curious, or consider me fondly.
I probably consider you fondly too, but more on that much later.

I am not sure about posting this post.
It is much more self-centered and personal than I feel comfortable with.
But today, June 10, is a day of protest in academia, at least in the sciences. Researchers decided to [#ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com) and I decided to join along by writing this post instead of working on my projects.
I am not quite in the sciences anymore, but the objective seems right.
It is important to take breaks every once and a while and consider current events.
While this post is in response to how I am in light of current events it can also be used as a cursory  summary of current thoughts related to all sorts of systemic failures.

My thoughts are not well organized.
Everything flows together.
I am overwhelmed.
Writing does not help much here, but maybe it will shed light on why I am overwhelmed to some of you.
These thoughts are the result of years of observations and experiences.
The impetus for posting is recent, but note that it is impossible to summarize a lifetime of experiences and observations in one afternoon.
Also note that I will only elaborate if and when I feel comfortable, and am mostly posting this so that I can take the time I need to focus on what I need to.
I do not have the bandwidth to host multiple discussions at the moment, but I do have time to continue friendships at their normal paces.
So let's focus on friendships, and work on tackling everything slowly, because I cannot mentally handle trying to tackle the entirety of racism and inequality in a few short, intense sittings.
Also, I feel like such an attempt is setting ourselves up for failure or not dedicating enough time to the problems.

It feels like I am not doing enough - that I am not working hard enough and fast enough if I do not have the bandwidth to do more.
If I am not working myself into exhaustion and responding instantaneously to everything happening it is hard to convince myself that what I do is enough.
I watch so many of you, my friends and acquaintances, charge forward so bravely to make change, but cannot join in everywhere and stay sane.
I am very proud of you, protestors, organizers, speakers, and the like, for knowing what you want to say and how you want to say it.

I wonder if writing this is worthwhile.
In the grand scheme of things, my particular reflections are just a drop in  the bucket.
There is so much else that is important to read about out there, much of it well researched and well organized.
I do not want my thoughts to take away from the important messages and information being shared within all sorts of communities.

Please, if you are curious, pay attention to what is being shared now.
Go out and educate yourselves.
There are so many resources currently being shared.
I find it important for you to explore, find your own research, make up your own minds, and have backing for your thoughts.
Please figure out what you believe, what you want to debate and why, what changes you want to see, and grow.
I also hope that in your explorations, you can see some of my motivations or where I am coming from.
Maybe you can catch a glimpse of me underneath the assumptions, expectations, and categorizations you have of me.
Maybe your explorations will help you see more of me, the person, rather than me, the stereotype.
Maybe research will help you see others who the world typecasts as the same as me.
Maybe we will become individuals, belonging to this world, with the same exact liberties and freedoms as everyone else in the US.
Maybe your research will help shed light on some of my more extreme seeming fears and behaviors, or just little things like why I am so insistent on following even silly seeming rules.
But please do your own research and do not expect me to be able to lead you to it.

Maybe one day I will be able to source information.
Maybe one day I will be able to curate it.
Right now, if you are lucky, I may be able to dredge up the bandwidth to point you in the direction of some resources, but do not count on it.

I do not have the bandwidth to explain everything to you.
I get that you are worried.
I am too - the world is such an intimidating place a the moment.
I need to process, to take time to decide my actions, to figure out how I feel, and to just do the things I need to do for survival and to meet my current objectives.
I need to figure out how I will work around the fear and trauma each question or post induces and do so in a way when I can support myself.
Social distancing does no favors right now.
As a single graduate student far from home there is more stress because I cannot take a break.
Isolation is tough mentally and virtual communications do not lighten the load.

My silence is not my sign of defeat.
It also does not mean I condone everything that is happening.
It just means I am trying to take care of myself.
I am one person with many responsibilities and limited time and resources. I am doing my best.
There is so much to do and I am working slowly to make changes.
I believe that this is where I can make an impact and that helping see gradual change is important.
Therefore, I am not constantly responding to the particular current events.
I am not ignoring them.
I am paying attention to the overall happenings of society at large over time.
This is especially important because for me, constantly processing current events and trends is hard.
I need to think, let ideas percolate, and experiment before I am confident going forward and making statements or releasing projects.
That makes the quick turnaround of today's social media culture and instant communications difficult to navigate.

I have never been particularly good at the instantaneous and have worked to stay calm for years when on the spot.
I do not always succeed.
Some of my former ballet and jazz class companions from Logrea's may remember the Cabaret performance where I froze on stage because I realized the audience was there.
Some of my high school classmates may remember my appearance in "The Challenge" during the 2008-2009 school year, where I froze when on TV, and the only answer I could come up with was related to the Sun Maid Raisins girl.
For years, I interviewed for tech jobs extremely poorly.
Anyone who has heard me answer a question on the spot may wonder why I have had access to the opportunities I have had over the years.

I work hard and show results over time.
Like my flute playing, I show results with time and practice, perhaps not always on demand, but with generally improving results.
My mathematical knowledge may not show itself on demand on assessments, but when working on a project, I can draw upon various areas of it to make logical model choices.
My creative projects are the sum of a bunch of small choices and research over time, not instantaneous results.
My technical knowledge that does not show in interviews shows itself through projects completed, repositories, workshops given, and courses taught.
When I dance, I dance in the moment, with technique built up over 26 years of dance training, but when asked to display one particular technique, I am often not able.
I am not eloquent on demand.
I tend not to remember technical terminology.
That makes my responses inelegant, but does not stop me from displaying my competencies through effort, work, and thought.
For these reasons, I am not prone to making statements on current events.
Instead, I work to make changes.

Sometimes, I think this contributes to the barriers I often face.
If my communication style is confusing, how can I progress?
Perhaps the way I tell stories meanders a bit.
Perhaps my word choice leaves much to be desired.
Perhaps I ramble.

At the same time, I wonder if it is solely my communication that is confusing, or if it is who it is coming from that makes it confusing.
When I use certain words, talk about certain experiences, break certain stereotypes, am I just breaking expectations?
Does the person delivering information in an unexpected way make it harder to understand the information?
And if so, is that because I am not what you expected, someone other than who you expect to see?
Is it because I do not fit your stereotypes of someone who is "black"?
Is it because I am a relatively young woman?
Is it because I am not "African American" enough?
Is it because "I don't look German American?"
Is it because I am single?
Is it because I am buddhist, or have different hobbies, education, and priorities than expected?
What about everything that is part of my identity that you just cannot see?
If my identity changes how you understand messages I share, why do certain aspects resonate more for you?

At the beginning of May, when classes ended, I planned out what I wanted to update this blog with next.
I wanted to update my about section to include my current artist statement.
I wanted to explain Intermedia as I see it and how my current artistic practices mesh with the concept.
I wanted to describe my most recent projects and update my projects and events pages.

However, that was not to be.
I told myself that I would update everything once I was done with my work.
I was overzealous - it is June, and I am still finishing up two projects that are now long overdue for my spring 2020 classes.
I kept telling myself that if I kept my head down and kept working, I would be done soon, and could finish everything I put off.
I still believe that will happen soon, but now this post comes first.

Quarantine conditions, a lack of the communal activities that ground me, the knowledge that I am so behind on my work, the stress of virtual social communications, and the ambient social unrest make concentrating consistently difficult.
I told myself that I just needed to power through.
I would be able to see my family and eventually put an end to my touch deprivation.
I would be able to spend a bit of time with some of the only people I am certain of liking me for me.
Like many who do not fit neatly into one category and are consistently othered for it, I am always a bit unsure about when being me is too difficult for my companions.

I want to be accepted as I am. I do not always want to fight or explain for the feeling of acceptance, and so I pick and choose my battles.
I try not to overextend myself in activities or social media involvment, giving myself the chance to rest.
I cannot keep up with the constant social connectivity expected in this age of hyper-connectivity, so I drop the ball on email chains, texts, virtual meetups, calls and the like.
And I do not have the personal bandwidth to let myself ride the waves of the constant outrage with society that I experience vicariously through social media and the news, so I make the decision to opt out.
I feel very guilty when doing so.
When I do so, I know that I cannot expect that others will understand or advocate for my point of view.
I worry that I will lose the opportunity to
However, keeping my sanity is important to me too.

## Frequent deaths and Systematic disrespect of Human lives

Recently, I have been angry.
There has been so much senseless death and disrespect of human life.

First, so many in my extended circles were dying from coronavirus.
While I have so far been fortunate and none of my personal acquaintances have died from coronavirus, death announcements were plentiful.
It felt like I saw one announcement a week.
More than  people in the nuclear family structures of people I have spent countless hours with died, and the fact that society could not do much about their losses was terrifying.

Then, two of my high school classmates died, too young, too suddenly, and  far too close together in timing.
I received notice about a week apart from each death.
I was not super close with either, and have a terrible memory so cannot share much specifically, but felt solidarity with both in different ways.
Claudia was super sweet and a fellow anime fan who I lost contact with.
Einne shared a set of life experiences that not many who went to high school with me knew well.
We did not talk much, but I always felt solidarity because he knew some of the struggles of having a blended/ mixed/ interracial family.
Both of these deaths felt like punches in the gut, especially after last year when one of my best friends fell victim to the same tragic.
I was mad at the fact that society fails so many people I know personally, so that so many feel like there is no place in society for them.
It is
People who fall into the other category like me.
