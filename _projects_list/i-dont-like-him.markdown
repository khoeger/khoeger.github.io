## About {{page.title}}
{{page.title}} provides a snapshot into the artistâ€™s thoughts.
Symbolic references to a close friend and crushes are made as she tells this friend a story about those crushes.
The artist uses her friend as a rubber ducky, referencing rubber ducky debugging.
Some symbols and rituals in the video connect her with her friend, others with various crushes, and some connect with both.

The video production and presentation process highlight various relationships.
The artist borrowed objects, included photos from other photographers, and using objects and locations easily accessible to students.
Fostering a community through borrowed objects and thriftiness both played a symbolic role in the making of this video.
