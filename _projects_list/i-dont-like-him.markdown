Through {{page.title}}, Katarina Hoeger examines her relationships with a cast of men not biologically related to her through the lens of a conversation with her deceased
best friend, also male.
The conversation leads to freeform letter writing sessions
and word associations depicted alongside recordings of her behavior as the piece
progresses.
The transitions include items the artist associates with each male's presence.

{{page.title}} was shown in the student work spaces, in a makeshift movie theater constructed from couches and  lockers, with a sheet as a screen, reminiscent of the makeshift nature of showing movies in an undergraduate
dorm.

{{page.title}} escapes Katarina's previous boundaries of strict data visualization and sonification and is a less premeditated and structured approach to art making than much of her prior work.
Through this work, the artist also explores personal symbology and fostering connections through borrowed objects.
