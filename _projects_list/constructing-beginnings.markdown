{{page.title}} explores the human commonality of new beginnings.
Using the artist's present new beginnings as inspiration, sounds and lights draw
mover-listener-viewers into {{page.title}}.
There is no official beginning to the experience, so mover-listener-viewers construct
their own.
They place their ears next to different pipes, make tracks in the sand, and listen to how the different audio tracks mixed differently throughout their journeys.
This work explores the flexibility and modularity characteristic of beginnings.
