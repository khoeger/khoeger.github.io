{{page.title}}, I created an environment participants
walked into. Prompted by sculpture, sounds, and wall text, participants
wandered throughout the space. They placed their ears next to different
pipes, made tracks in the sand, and listened to how the different audio
tracks mixed differently throughout their journeys. Some also attempted
to listen to audio sections in their entirety. Participants were drawn into
the space via sound and the invitation of fairy lights. A space on the side
was created so that the participants could sit and ponder the experience.
Conceptually, the work explored what was on my mind, all the new
beginnings experienced due to a move to Maine, using a medium that I
wanted to get better facility with, sound. New beginnings are a human
commonality, and using my own thoughts as a entryway, I created a view
into this common experience.
Though there were no official instructions, carefully considering the
layout of the experience led to much more willing engagement with my
work. There was no official beginning, so the participant constructed
their own. This project helped me realize the importance of flexibility
and making work modular enough so that if part of the infrastructure
fails or the installation is not viable, a replacement or work-around can
be found.
