Elsewhere is a video exploration of thoughts, memory, being present, and alternative human connection. It considers one view of what it means to be elsewhere - to be “in or to another place”. The photographs are a mix of my current reality and photos from memories. Part of the audio is created based on recordings of people related to the memories. The rest is based on physical happenings in your brain. All events are carefully timed. The timings with which images cycle and the timings with which sounds occur enhance this exploration into thought processes.
