{{page.title}} is an ongoing exploration.
With it, Katarina documents the present by considering the constituent parts that make up the documentation and building upon them to create an output.

Visuals in this series, pictured, have been generated from custom code created by the artist. The artist uses color data retrieved from pictures to reconstitute images.
Sounds generated in this series have been generated from custom code.

Part of this work in progress was presented at the 2021 Intermedia MFA Open House.
This work was iterated upon and a workshop was constructed around its origins at the Bethany Arts Community Fall 2022
Visuals generated as part of this series have been projected, sent to recipients through the mail, and shown online. The sounds have, as of yet, only been heard in person, as 4-channel sound.
